                            Welcome to my Pinhole camera workshop, after being so submerged in the digital for the last
                            year, let's throw it back to the analog. Making a pinhole camera is a super easy and cheap
                            way of capturing photographs at home. The earliest mention of a pinhole camera being used
                            was as early as the fifth century! Take on the challenge create like us humans have been
                            doing forever! Don’t forget to share your results by using the hashtag #luvalunch​

                                In this workshop, I will be showing you ways of developing your photographs at home
                                using a chemical called caffenol (likely to be found in your kitchen cupboard)! No need
                                to spend all your money on an array of different chemicals, this method is way less
                                harmful to the environment, so how could you not! I hope you enjoy creating and
                                developing your photographs from start to finish. Don’t forget to share your results by
