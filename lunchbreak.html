            Getting tired of boring lunch breaks when working or studying from home? look no further because weâ€™ve got
            you covered. Everyday of the week commencing 15th March, we will be releasing short tutorial videos to
            introduce you to new and creative
            lunchtime activities.
            <br><br>
            Spice up your day and get those creative juices flowing; take a break with LDVA!
            <br><br>
            Combined, these workshop sessions will result in your own unique homemade zine. The following week on the 25th of March, we
            are facilitating an 'Open Table' event. This will be an opportunity to share the work created and also to
            socialize and get to know other creatives. We will be sharing what worked for us and how we all used the
            different techniques to take a break and do something creative in our lunch times.
