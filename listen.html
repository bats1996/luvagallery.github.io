        <strong>The School of the Damned (SotD)</strong> is an arts and educational platform. Re-forming on an annual
        basis, each cohort has the opportunity to define the agenda and produce work and events individually and
        collectively. SotD was formed in 2014 as a reaction to the increasing financialisation of Higher Education in
        the UK. SotD has no tuition fees, is student led and peer supported. We use our collective resources and
        networks to make the things we want to happen, happen. Available <a
