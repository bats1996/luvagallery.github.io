    <h3>AND THE WINNER IS...</h3>
    <p>
      VENICE AGENDAS 2019: THE MARKET attempts to examine the financial mechanism that powers the art world. How does
      the system of the art market work? Who are the beneficiaries and who are the losers? Initiating ideas with round
      table discussions and commissions of new work, Venice Agendas intends to explore the impact of the art market on
      the territory and environment that artists, institutions, curators and writers have to navigate to create, present
      and discuss original contemporary artwork.
      <br><br>
      The VA19 project will continues in the UK with a series of discussions, events and artist commissions until
      December 2019. We are delighted to announce that we are working with Islington Mill Art Academy, Salford. LUVA,
      Bethnal Green, London. Invigilators Research Network, London, Artemotion, Bristol, HOP Projects, Folkestone and
      MAD FOR REAL, International.
      <br><br>

      Roger De Haan Charitable Trust, theartistsagency and funded with public money from the National Lottery through
