    <h2>Jordan McKenzie</h2>
    <h3>NO ONE IS EVER GOING TO GIVE YOU THE EDUCATION YOU NEED TO OVERTHROW THEM</h3>
    <p>Humorously nodding to Dutch interior painting but also referencing the checker board Lino that Mckenzie found in
      his flat when he first moved into the estate where this exhibition is presented, No One Is Ever Going To Give You
      The Education You Need To Overthrow Them is a chaotic jumble of works that fight for space and attention. Drawings
      plastered to the wall, cardboard, hastily made paintings and found materials. The clichés of estate living are all
      here, discarded mattresses, gas bottles, a throw away BBQ set but also the claustrophobia of close quarter living,
      spaces that are managed and bound in the red tape of bureaucracy. The whole exhibition feels temporary and that it
      could all be swept away at any moment. to become yet more detritus. The laughing men in suits with their big
      grabbing hands are never far away from the borders of the estate with their cost-effective planning suggestions
      and ever more pernicious strategies of privatisation. But there is also deep joy to be found in these
      instrumentalized spaces, small resistances that force their way through like a flower growing through
      concrete...ahh...more clichés....
