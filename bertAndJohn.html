    <h2>Bert McLean & John Walter</h2>
    <h3>CREP SUZETTE</h3>
    <p>Crep Suzette: A Shoe Show is a new collaborative installation by John Walter and Bert McLean. The artists have
      known each other for 15 years but this is the first time they have exhibited together. The show title puns on the
      slang for a trainer and the classic French dessert. Walter and McLean have both been using shoes in their recent
      work. For Walter this is manifest as an interest in the anachronistic children’s cartoon The Shoe People, which
      feature in his new large-scale acrylic paintings The Shoe People Paisley. For McLean this is manifest in a series
      of paintings and sculptures called Balenci Wontons that conflate his studies at Cordwainer’s College, his 1000
      strong collection of shoe drawings from childhood and his experience working at the Thai pop up restaurant Bangkok
      Delivery Boy. These two diverse bodies of shoe themed work collide in a shared aesthetic philosophy that favours
      the shonky, the maximal and the popular. Prepare to enter this year’s hottest shit-flicker!

      <strong>Dr John Walter</strong> is a multimedia artist, curator and academic. He studied at The Ruskin School of

      <strong>Bert McLean</strong> (b.1998, London) is a cardboard artist. He was born, educated and currently works in
      East London. His artistic training began at the Royal Drawing School followed by a year designing and making shoes
      at the Cordwainer’s College at the London College of Fashion. He will commence the Fine Art programme at the
      Gerrit Reitveld Academie in Amsterdam this autumn. This year Bert has initiated, run and curated a public art
      space called Do Your Own Thing Space (DYOT) in Hackney. Starting out as a coffee bar, the space soon became part
      live studio, part event and gallery space for young and local artists to put on weeklong shows of
      work-in-progress. He received the Southwark Park Galleries Annual Salon Prize (2018) for his painting Classic Skid
      Grill.
