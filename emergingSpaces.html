        <h2>LDVA Editions: Emerging Artist-Led Spaces</h2>
        <h3>An online panel discussion with a selection of creatives running artist-led spaces</h3>
        <h3 style="font-size:20px">28th January 2021 at 18:30</h3>

        <p>
            After a challenging year, weâ€™re aiming to bring together artist-led spaces in a discussion about how we can
            collaboratively encourage emerging artists and support artist-led spaces that are moving away from
            traditional forms of
            exhibiting as well as how we, as galleries, have had to reposition ourselves during a pandemic. All
            participants are from non- profit organisations and
            artist-led spaces, all working in the field of contemporary art as collaborative and community-integrated.

            <br><br>

            <strong>LDVA Gallery</strong> aims to benefit the local community and promote dialogue between the creative
            and the public.
            We have transitioned from <strong>LUPA</strong> (Lock Up Performance Arts) to <strong>LUVA</strong> (Lock Up
            Visual Arts) in 2018 and are currently
            <strong>LDVA</strong> (Lock Down Visual Arts) until we can open our garage door again.
            We are an intergenerational artist-run organisation centering around a lock-up garage in Tower Hamlets. We
            work with
            the First Love Foundation food bank and community center, aiming to reach out to the local community as well
            as the art community.

            <strong>Lucie MacGregor - Garden Wall</strong>
            <br>
            A project that grew (literally) from a garden, founder <a href="https://www.luciemacgregor.com/">Lucie MacGregor</a> is a mixed-media artist who's
            making is concerned with social interaction and intervention. During the peculiar last few months, her
            garden became a site of sanctuary and reflection, she found herself meandering through making sculpture from
            objects from around her home and the street outside whilst sharing her make-shift studio space with the
            immediate processes of planting and gardening. The limited garden space she has access to in SE London
            became an unconventional site for playing with materials, combining structures with seedlings, rocks with
            paint, clay with shells. Lockdown provided an unlikely situation for the artist to consider the garden as a
            place to make art and to share collective discussion.
