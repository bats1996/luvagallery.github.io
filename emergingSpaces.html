        <h2>LDVA Editions: Emerging Artist-Led Spaces</h2>
        <h3>An online panel discussion with a selection of creatives running artist-led spaces</h3>
        <h3 style="font-size:20px">28th January 2021 at 18:30</h3>

        <p>
            After a challenging year, weâ€™re aiming to bring together artist-led spaces in a discussion about how we can
            collaboratively encourage emerging artists and support artist-led spaces that are moving away from traditional forms of
            exhibiting as well as how we, as galleries, have had to reposition ourselves during a pandemic. All participants are from non- profit organisations and
            artist-led spaces, all working in the field of contemporary art as collaborative and community-integrated.

            <br><br>

            <strong>LDVA Gallery</strong> aims to benefit the local community and promote dialogue between the creative and the public.
            We have transitioned from <strong>LUPA</strong> (Lock Up Performance Arts) to <strong>LUVA</strong> (Lock Up Visual Arts) in 2018 and are currently
            <strong>LDVA</strong> (Lock Down Visual Arts) until we can open our garage door again.
            We are an intergenerational artist-run organisation centering around a lock-up garage in Tower Hamlets. We work with
            the First Love Foundation food bank and community center, aiming to reach out to the local community as well as the art community.
