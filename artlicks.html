    How can diverse organisations work together to challenge traditional arts and cultural spaces, specifically avoiding and countering the effects of gentrification?<br>
    How can we ensure that arts spaces create meaningful internships that are not exploitative and give young practitioners a rounded experience?<br>
    Guests will include:<br></p>
